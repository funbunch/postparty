          <p className="space">Most issues can be resolved quickly and amicably by contacting Epic player support at <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/customer-service" className="text-[#2764bb]">https://www.epicgames.com/customer-service.</a> But we understand that sometimes disputes can’t be easily resolved by player support. This Section explains how you and Epic agree to resolve those disputes, including (where applicable) by binding, individual arbitration.</p>

          <p className="space"><span className="font-bold">a.	Informal Resolution</span><br />
        If you have an issue that our player support can’t resolve, prior to starting arbitration you and Epic agree to attempt to resolve the dispute informally to help get us to a resolution and reduce costs for both parties. You and Epic agree to make a good-faith effort to negotiate any dispute between us for at least 30 days (“<span className="font-bold">Informal Resolution</span>”). This 30 day period starts on the day you or Epic receive a written notice of a dispute from the other party (a “<span className="font-bold">Notice of Dispute</span>”) in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
          <p className="space">You will send your Notice of Dispute to Epic Games, Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: NOTICE OF DISPUTE, Box 254, 2474 Walnut Street, Cary, North Carolina, 27518, U.S.A. Include your name, any relevant account name you use, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want Epic to do. If Epic has a dispute with you that is subject to Informal Resolution, Epic will send our Notice of Dispute to your registered email address and any billing address you have provided us</p>

          <p className="space">If the dispute isn’t resolved within 30 days by Informal Resolution or small-claims court (below), you or Epic may start an arbitration in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
          <p className="space">
          <span className="font-bold">b.	Small Claims Court</span><br />
          Instead of using Informal Resolution, you and Epic agree that you may sue us in small-claims court in your choice of the county where you live or Wake County, North Carolina (if you meet the requirements of small-claims court). We hope you’ll try Informal Resolution first, but you don’t have to before going to small-claims court.</p>
          <p className="space">
          <span className="font-bold">c.	Binding Individual Arbitration</span><br />
          THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS IN THIS SECTION WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY.</p>
          <p className="space">
        You and Epic agree that Disputes (as defined below) will be settled by binding individual arbitration conducted by the <a href="#" className="text-[#2764bb]">Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc.</a> (“<span className="font-bold">JAMS</span>”) subject to the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law and according to the <a href="#" className="text-[#2764bb]">JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures</a> effective July 1, 2014 (the “<span className="font-bold">JAMS Rules</span>”) as modified by this Agreement.</p>
    
        <p className="space"> This means that you and Epic agree to a dispute-resolution process where we submit any Dispute to a neutral arbitrator (not a judge or jury) that makes the final decision to resolve the Dispute. The arbitrator may award the same remedies to you individually as a court could, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.</p>
        <p className="legal ul">The arbitrator’s decision is final, except for a limited review by courts under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and can be enforced like any other court order or judgment.</p><br />
        <ul className="list-none">
          <li><span className="font-bold">(i)	Disputes We Agree to Arbitrate</span><br />
            You and Epic agree to submit all Disputes between you and Epic to individual binding arbitration. “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy (except those specifically exempted below) between you and Epic that relates to your use or attempted use of the Services or the Services generally, including without limitation the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Binding Individual Arbitration section.<br /><br />

            You and Epic agree to arbitrate all Disputes regardless of whether the Dispute is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory.<br /><br />

            The Informal Resolution and Binding Individual Arbitration sections do not apply to (i) individual actions in small-claims court; (ii) pursuit of enforcement actions through a government agency if the law allows; (iii) a complaint or remedy under the EU General Data Protection Regulation; (iv) an action to compel or uphold any prior arbitration decision; (v) Epic’s right to seek injunctive relief against you in a court of law to preserve the status quo while an arbitration proceeds; (vi) claims of piracy; creation, distribution, or promotion of cheats; and intellectual-property infringement; and (vii) the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below.<br /><br />

            You and Epic agree that whether a dispute is subject to arbitration under this Agreement will be determined by the arbitrator rather than a court.<br /><br /></li>
            <li><span className="font-bold">(ii)	Arbitration Procedure</span><br />
            To start an arbitration, follow the instructions for initiating an arbitration on the JAMS website. You will send a copy of any Demand for Arbitration to Epic Games, Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: ARBITRATION OF DISPUTE, Box 254, 2474 Walnut Street, Cary, North Carolina, 27518, U.S.A. Epic will send any Demand for Arbitration to the email address and any billing address you have provided us.<br /><br />

            The arbitration will be conducted by a single JAMS arbitrator selected with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. You and Epic both agree that the arbitration will be conducted in the English language and that the arbitrator will be bound by this Agreement.<br /><br />

            If an in-person hearing is required, the hearing will take place either in Wake County, North Carolina, or where you reside; you choose.<br /><br />

            The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve the Dispute. Unless you and Epic agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision of each claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator’s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions.<br /><br />

            The arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are requested by you or Epic to satisfy one of our individual claims (that the arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence). The arbitrator may not award relief against Epic respecting any person other than you.<br /><br />

            Any decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable, application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement.<br /><br /></li>
          <li><span className="font-bold">(iii)	Arbitration Fees and Location</span><br />
            If you start the arbitration, you must pay the JAMS filing fee required for consumer arbitrations.<br />
            <br />
            In some situations, Epic will help with your fees to (hopefully) get us to a resolution quickly and fairly:<br /><br />

            If the Dispute involves a claim of damages of USD $10,000 or less, Epic will pay all of the JAMS costs, including the fees you otherwise would have been required to pay.<br /><br />

            If the above doesn’t apply to you, but you demonstrate that arbitration costs will be prohibitive compared to litigation costs, Epic will pay as much of your JAMS costs as the arbitrator finds is necessary to prevent arbitration from being cost-prohibitive (as compared to the cost of litigation).  <br /> <br />

            Subject to the last paragraph of this section, even if Epic wins the arbitration and the applicable law or the JAMS Rules allow Epic to seek our portion of the JAMS fees from you, we won’t.<br /><br />

            JAMS costs do not include your attorneys’ fees and costs, and attorneys’ fees and JAMS costs are not counted when determining whether a Dispute involves a claim of damages of USD$10,000 or less.
            <br /><br />
            Subject to the last paragraph of this section, Epic won’t seek our attorneys’ fees or expenses from you in any arbitration, even if the law or the JAMS Rules entitle us to do so. If you choose to be represented by an attorney, you will pay your own attorneys’ fees and costs unless the applicable law provides otherwise.<br /> <br />

            The provisions in this section are contingent upon you bringing your arbitration claim in “good faith”. If the arbitrator finds you brought an arbitration claim against Epic for an improper purpose, frivolously, or without a sufficient pre-claim investigation into the facts or applicable law, then the payment of all fees and awards, including any right Epic may have to seek our portion of the JAMS fees or attorneys’ fees or expenses from you, will be governed by the JAMS Rules.<br /><br /> 
            </li>
          <li><span className="font-bold">(iv) Notice and Filing</span><br/>
          If a Dispute must be arbitrated, you or Epic must start arbitration of the Dispute within two (2) years from when the Dispute first arose. If applicable law requires you to bring a claim for a Dispute sooner than two years after the Dispute first arose, you must start arbitration in that earlier time period. Epic encourages you to tell us about a Dispute as soon as possible so we can work to resolve it. The failure to provide timely notice shall bar all claims.<br /><br /></li>
          <li><span className="font-bold">(v)	Continuation in Effect</span><br/>
          This Binding Individual Arbitration section survives any termination of this Agreement or Epic’s provision of Services to you.<br /><br /></li>
          <li><span className="font-bold">(vi)	Future Terms Changes</span><br />
          Although Epic may revise this Agreement in its discretion, Epic does not have the right to alter this Agreement to arbitrate or the rules specified herein with respect to any Dispute once that Dispute arises.</li>
        </ul><br />
        
        <p className="legal ul"><span className="font-bold">d. Class Action Waiver</span><br/>
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you and Epic agree to only bring Disputes in an individual capacity and shall not:</p>
         <ul className="lists">
          <li>seek to bring, join, or participate in any class or representative action, collective or class-wide arbitration, or any other action where another individual or entity acts in a representative capacity (e.g., private attorney general actions); or</li>
          <li>consolidate or combine individual proceedings or permit an arbitrator to do so without the express consent of all parties to this Agreement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="space"><span className="font-bold">e.	Severability</span><br/>
        If all or any provision of this Binding Individual Arbitration section is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then you and Epic agree that the provision will be severed, and the rest of this Agreement shall remain in effect and be construed as if any severed provision had not been included. The sole exception is that if the Class Action Waiver is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, you and Epic agree that it will not be severable; this entire Binding Individual Arbitration section will be void and unenforceable and any dispute will be resolved in court subject to the venue and choice of clauses specified in this Agreement. Under no circumstances shall arbitration be conducted on a class basis without Epic’s express consent.</p>
        <p className="space"><span className="font-bold">f.	Your 30-Day Right to Opt Out</span><br />
        You have the right to opt out of and not to be bound by the Binding Individual Arbitration and Class Action Waiver provisions set forth in this Agreement. To exercise this right, you must send written notice of your decision to the following address: Epic Games, Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: ARBITRATION OPT-OUT, Box 254, 2474 Walnut Street, Cary, North Carolina, 27518, U.S.A.

If you opt out of these provisions, Epic will not be bound by them with respect to Disputes with you.</p>

          11. Miscellaneous </p>
          <p className="space">This Agreement, including any other terms and policies referenced in this Agreement, are the entire agreement between you and Epic concerning the Services and supersede any other agreements between you and Epic. Unless otherwise contemplated in this Agreement, there are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement. No waiver of this Agreement by Epic shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of that term or condition or any other term or condition, and any failure of Epic to assert a right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, that provision will be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that, except as stated in Section 10(e), the remaining provisions of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. You may not assign your rights or obligations under this Agreement, including any rights to use the Services. We may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, with or without notice to you.
